In this workshop we will learn about the risk of script injection in GitHub Actions workflows, and how to mitigate that risk.  

- **Who is this for**: developers, devops engineers
- **What you'll learn**: the risk of script Injections in GitHub Actions workflows, and how to migirate that risk
- **What you'll build**: workflows that are not vulnerable to script injection attacks

## Learning Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

  - learn about script injection vulnerabilities in GitHub actions workflows
  - learn how to mitigate script injection vulnerabilities in GitHub actions workflows
  - learn how Github Advanced Security can help you build secure GitHub actions workfows

## :mega: Prerequisites
Before joining the workshop, there are a few items that you will need to install or bring with you.
- an account on GitHub.com
- a public repo created from this template repo

## :bomb: Exercise 1: Script injection in the run command

There are many issue ops things you can do with GitHub actions. A common use case is request/approval process:
1. User opens an issue requesting X.
2. If conditions are met, approval is automatic, and a GitHub actions workflow fulfills the request.

An example of this is [request-repo-create](https://github.com/robandpdx/request-repo-create).  

In this example, user input from the issue body is parsed and used in the workflow as the name of the new repository to be created.  

You should always be careful when using user inputs in your worfklows. User input can come from any of the following sources:

github.event.issue.title
github.event.issue.body
github.event.pull_request.title
github.event.pull_request.body
github.event.comment.body
github.event.review.body
github.event.review_comment.body
github.event.pages.*.page_name
github.event.commits.*.message
github.event.head_commit.message
github.event.head_commit.author.email
github.event.head_commit.author.name
github.event.commits.*.author.email
github.event.commits.*.author.name
github.event.pull_request.head.ref
github.event.pull_request.head.label
github.event.pull_request.head.repo.default_branch
github.head_ref

The [Check issue title workflow](.github/workflows/check-issue-title.yml) simply checks if the title (github.event.issue.title) of the workflow begins with `octocat`. If so, the workflow succeeds. If not, the workflow fails.  

The [Check issue title with action workflow](.github/workflows/check-issue-title-with-action.yml) uses an [action](.github/actions/check-issue-title-action/action.yml) that simply checks if the input of the action begins with `octocat`. If so, the action succeeds. If not, the action fails.  

This workflow and action abore are vulnerable to script injection. Let's find out why they are vulnerable, how to exploit them, and how to fix them.

## :bomb: Exercise 2 - Script injection in github-script action

The [Check issue comment](.github/workflows/check-issue-comment.yml) workflow simply checks if the issue comment (github.event.comment.body) begins with `octocat`. If so, the workflow succeeds. If not, the workflow fails.  

This workflow is vulnerable to script injection. Let's find out why it is vulnerable, how to exploit it, and how to fix it.

## :mag: Exercise 5 - Mitigate using CodeQL Action Workflow

Let's create an actions workflow to scan our workflow files using CodeQL.  
[Exercise 5](./exercises/exercise-5.md)  

## :european_castle: Exercise 6 - Enhance the detection of vulnerabilities using third party queries

Now let's look at another way we can use CodeQL to secure our GitHub actions workflows.
